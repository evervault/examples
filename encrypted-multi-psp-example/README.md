## Build Encrypted Card Payments Across Multiple Payment Processors

This repo will help you build a card payments app to be used across multiple payment service providers (PSPs) using Evervault Inputs.

Inputs encrypts customer card data and keeps it encrypted as it moves from your client to your server.

You can then pass the encrypted card data to multiple payment processors, such as Checkout.com and Stripe, where Outbound Relay automatically decrypts the card details. You can add additional payment processors as needed.

To get an idea of what it will look like at the end of the guide, watch [this demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQ8_ZDBJdTM). You can follow along step by step from our [Guides](https://docs.evervault.com/guides/multi-psp).
